# College_Football_Conference_Realignment
The college football landscape is rapidly changing.  As teams position themselves to maximize profits from TV revenue, traditional conferences are collapsing.  Realignment heated up in August of 2022 when UCLA and USC suprisingly annouced they would leave their 60 year conference affiliation to join the Big Ten.  The announcement came days after the Big Ten and Fox Sports agreed on a 7 year $7 Billion tv media rights contract.  A year later when the PAC 12 renegotiated their tv agreement with ESPN, ESPN offered each school $30 million a year in TV revenue.  That low number resulted in the collapse of the conference as 6 other schools left the allience.  

News of this filled the airwaves on ESPN radio. On my favorite radio show, Bishop and Friends, the host tried to make sense of the situation.  As a passionate college football fan, and someone who likes to make sense out of messy situations, I created this Tableau dashboard solving the realignment issue. I emailed it to the host.  A few days later, the show began with a 10 minute discussion of the solutions presented in this dashboard.  They loved the two league format, the selection of teams in their proposed conferences, and they especially liked the Playoff format.  The interactive dashboard may be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bryan.hamilton27/viz/CollegeFootballConferenceRealignmentModel/MainPage)
