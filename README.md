# College_Football_Conference_Realignment
The college football landscape is rapidly changing.  Traditional conference affiliations are collapsing as teams position themselves to maximize profits from TV.  Realignment heated up in August of 2022 when UCLA and USC suprisingly annouced they would leave their 60 year PAC 12 affiliation to join the Big Ten.  The announcement came days after the Big Ten and Fox Sports agreed on a 7 year $7 Billion tv media rights contract.  A year later when the PAC 12 renegotiated their tv agreement with ESPN, ESPN offered each school $30 million a year in TV revenue.  That low number resulted in the collapse of the conference as 6 other schools left the allience.  

News of this filled the airwaves on ESPN radio. On my favorite radio show, Bishop and Friends, the host tried to make sense of the situation.  As a passionate college football fan, and someone who likes to make sense out of messy situations, I created this Tableau dashboard. I emailed my solution to the host.  A few days later, the show began with a 10 minute discussion of this dashboard.  They loved the creation of the Championship League, the selection of teams in their proposed conferences, and they especially liked the Playoff format.  The interactive dashboard may be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bryan.hamilton27/viz/CollegeFootballConferenceRealignmentModel/MainPage)

## This dashboard answers the following questions:
1.  ?
2.  What happens to the remaing 80 Division 1 football programs?
4.  How can playoff teams be determined in a non-subjective manner?

### What will happen to former PAC 12 teams:
The sudden end of the PAC 12 nightmare created a realignment nightmare.  The nightmare began in 2022 when USC and UCLA joined the Big Ten.


### The Promotion League:
Not every college football program can compete in the Championship League.  


### Creating a new Playoff System:
The current playoff format consists of a Playoff Selection COmmittee of 13 people selecting the 4 top teams at the end of the season based off of inconsistant criteria.  One team may be selected to the playoffs based on a strong strength of schedule while another team may be selected based on the fact that they look like a good team that can compete in the playoffs. THe subjective opinions often result in dersiving teams left out of the playoffs.  Eventhoguh the number of playoff teams increase to 12 in 2024, the subjective process remains.

The Playoff system above displayes a simple non-subjective playoff system.  The winners of each conference division in the Champions League will be seeded based on record.  The top seed will host the 4th seeded team at home while the 2nd team host the 3rd seed team. Winners of the first round games will play for the Confrence Championsip on a neutral field.  Finally, the Conference Champions will face off on New Year's Day in The Rose Bowl for the National CHampionship.  

The playoff format for the Promotion League follows a similar format.  COnference Champions will be seeded based off of record and play in either the Fiesta Bowl or the Cotton Bowl.  The Promotion BOwl will be the first game on New Year's Day.
